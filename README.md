# QEC21 Workshop: Progress and Challenges in Quantum Intermediate Representations

The 2021 quantum intermediate representations workshop is hosted at IEEE Quantum Week, the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE).

[Confrence and workshop registration](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/registration/registration-overview/)

The virtual workshop will be held online on Friday, Oct 22 10:45-16:45 Mountain Time (MDT) â€” UTC-6.

## Description

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for discussing current state-of-the-art approaches to quantum intermediate representation development, expression, deployment, and utility.
We will highlight recent approaches, future directions, and novel designs through a series of invited presentations and panel discussions on specific challenge topics from leaders in the field of quantum compilation.

## Program

### Session 1:  Interacting with Physical Hardware
#### 10:45-12:15 Mountain Time

_Exactly how much knowledge of the electronic control system does the IR need to possess? Do we need explicit wall clock timing? Should IRs have knowledge of analog pulse control?_
 
**Moderator: Ken Brown (Duke)**
- Presentations (20 min each) 
  - Thomas Alexander and Lauren Capelutto (IBM)
  - Itamar Sivan (Quantum Machines)
- Panel Discussion (50 min)
  - Ross Duncan (CQC)
  - Wim Lavrijsen (LBL)
  - TBC

### Break: 12:15 PM - 12:45 PM 

### Session 2: Classical Control and Feedback
#### 12:45-14:15 PM Mountian Time

_Focus on the interplay between an IR and the classical infrastructure involved in fast-feedback and classical control. How does one handle and manage latency for measurement-based control flow?_

**Moderator: Will Zeng (Unitary Fund)**

- Presentations (20 min each) 
  - Blake Johnson (IBM)
  - Eric Holland (Keysight)
- Panel Discussion (50 min)
  - Steven Heidel (Amazon)
  - Andrew Landahl (Sandia)
  - Alex Chernoguzov (Honeywell)

### Break: 14:15 PM - 14:45 PM

### Session 3: Program Analysis and Memory Management
#### 14:45-16:15 PM Mountian Time

_At some point, QPUs will go beyond a single global register with some predefined connectivity. For example, we will need floating and fixed point arithmetic, or we might have specialized areas of processors dedicated to specific tasks like T-state generation. How should the IR relate to this?_

**Moderator: Bettina Heim (Microsoft)**

- Presentations (20 min each) 
  - Thomas Haner (Microsoft)
  - Kesha Hietala (University of Maryland)
- Panel Discussion (50 min)
  - Benjamin Bichsel (ETH-Zurich)
  - Alan Geller (Microsoft)
  - Yunong Shi (Amazon)

### Extra discussion time: 16:15 PM - 16:45 P
